# Vue3Project
Simple Vue3 project to test out Vue3. 
Click on the Zip file and download it for the files.
Using Vue CLI and Vite for the project. 
Run these commands in the terminal window to install Vue. 
npm install -g @vue/cli 
sudo npm install -g @vue/cli.
Once installed make sure it’s version 4.5 or above with  
vue --version. 
You have to make sure that you have the most up-to-date version of the Vue CLI and we can do that by running npm update -g @vue/cli our terminal.
Next, to create our project, you want to run vue create <PROJECT-NAME>
If you successfully updated our CLI, we should have an option to choose Vue 3.

Once you choose the Vue 3 option, our app should build. When it’s done, we just have to go inside our project and then run our Vue app. The commands for that are:
cd <PROJECT-NAME>
npm run serve
Now, if we navigate to our http://localhost:8080/ in our browser, we should see our app.
